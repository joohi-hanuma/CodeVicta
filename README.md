Drowsiness & Yawning Detection with USB Vibration Alert
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a real-time driver safety monitoring system that detects drowsiness and yawning using a webcam feed.
When a detection is made, the system sends a signal to a USB relay module, which triggers a USB vibration motor to alert the driver.

Designed to be low-cost, portable, and easy to integrate with laptops or embedded systems like the Jetson Nano.

ðŸš— Features

Drowsiness Detection â†’ Uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect prolonged eye closure.

Yawning Detection â†’ Uses Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) to detect prolonged mouth opening.

Real-Time Alerts â†’ Activates vibration motor through USB relay module.

Adjustable Sensitivity â†’ EAR and MAR thresholds can be customized.

No Special Camera Needed â†’ Works with laptop webcam or any USB webcam.

ðŸ›  Hardware Requirements

USB Relay Module (1-channel, 5V)

USB Vibration Motor (USB powered)

USB A-to-B Cable (printer-style) for connecting relay to laptop

Laptop/PC with USB ports and webcam

ðŸ’» Software Requirements

Python 3.11.9

Libraries:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe pandas pyserial


USB Relay Driver (most modules are plug-and-play, some may need a driver)

âš™ How It Works

Webcam captures driverâ€™s face in real-time.

MediaPipe detects facial landmarks for eyes and mouth.

EAR & MAR values are calculated from the landmarks.

If thresholds are crossed:

Sends command to USB relay module via PySerial.

Relay powers USB vibration motor â†’ alerts driver.
