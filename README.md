Drowsiness & Yawning Detection with USB Vibration Alert
ðŸ“Œ Overview: 

This project is a real-time driver safety monitoring system that detects drowsiness and yawning using a webcam feed.
When a detection is made, the system sends a signal to a USB relay module, which triggers a USB vibration motor to alert the driver.

Designed to be low-cost, portable, and easy to integrate with laptops or embedded systems like the Jetson Nano.

ðŸš— Features:

Drowsiness Detection â†’ Uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect prolonged eye closure.

Yawning Detection â†’ Uses Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) to detect prolonged mouth opening.

Real-Time Alerts â†’ Activates vibration motor through USB relay module.

Adjustable Sensitivity â†’ EAR and MAR thresholds can be customized.

No Special Camera Needed â†’ Works with laptop webcam or any USB webcam.

ðŸ›  Hardware Requirements:

USB Relay Module (1-channel, 5V)

USB Vibration Motor (USB powered)

USB A-to-B Cable (printer-style) for connecting relay to laptop

Laptop/PC with USB ports and webcam

ðŸ’» Software Requirements:

Python 3.11.9

Libraries:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe pandas pyserial


USB Relay Driver (most modules are plug-and-play, some may need a driver)

âš™ How It Works

Webcam captures driverâ€™s face in real-time.

MediaPipe detects facial landmarks for eyes and mouth.

EAR & MAR values are calculated from the landmarks.

If thresholds are crossed:

Sends command to USB relay module via PySerial.

Relay powers USB vibration motor â†’ alerts driver.

Relay Output â†’ USB Vibration Motor

Vibration motor is powered only when relay is activated.

ðŸ“¦ Libraries Used:

Below are the Python libraries required for this project:

OpenCV â€“ For video capturing, image processing, and face landmark detection.

Mediapipe â€“ For facial landmark detection (eyes and mouth).

PySerial â€“ For communication with external devices (e.g., DC motor, Arduino).

SciPy â€“ For calculating distances between facial landmarks (EAR, MAR).

NumPy â€“ For numerical operations.

Pandas â€“ For storing and analyzing detection data.

Playsound / Pygame (optional) â€“ For playing alert sounds.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements:

Adjustable EAR/MAR thresholds via GUI.

Multi-feature driver safety system (lane departure, collision detection).

IoT integration for fleet monitoring.
